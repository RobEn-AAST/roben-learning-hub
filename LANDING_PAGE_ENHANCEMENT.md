3. **Add Admins**: Create users with role 'admin' in profiles
4. **View Live**: Navigate to the home page to see real-time data

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Colors
Update the gradient colors in each component:
```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-700"
```

### Adjust Animations
Modify animation parameters in Framer Motion:
```tsx
transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: "easeOut" }}
```

### Change 3D Elements
Update shapes in `3d-elements.tsx`:
```tsx
<boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
- Ensure database has published courses
- Check that users have proper roles set
- Verify API endpoint is accessible

### 3D Elements Not Rendering
- Check browser WebGL support
- Ensure Three.js dependencies are installed
- Clear browser cache

### Slow Performance
- Reduce number of 3D shapes
- Optimize images
- Use production build for testing
